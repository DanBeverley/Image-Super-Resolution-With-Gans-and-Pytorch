# Image Super Resolution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with PyTorch

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an Image Super Resolution (SR) model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with PyTorch framework. The goal of this project is to enhance the resolution of low-resolution images, producing high-quality, realistic images with more details.

The model is trained on the [Image Super Resolution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityachandrasekhar/image-super-resolution) available on Kaggle. This dataset consists of pairs of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images across various categories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
- Kaggle API (for downloading the dataset)

## Dataset

The Image Super Resolution Dataset contains LR-HR image pairs suitable for training an SR model. It includes a diverse range of images covering different scenes, objects, and resolutions. To use this dataset, you need to download it from the Kaggle dataset page and organize it into the appropriate directory structure.

### Dataset Structure:

```

│   └── low_res/
├── train/
│   ├── high_res/
│   └── low_res/

└── val/
    ├── high_res/
    └── low_res/
```

## Model Architecture

The SR model is based on a GANs architecture, consisting of a generator and a discriminator:

- **Generator**: The generator network takes LR images as input and generates HR images with higher resolution. It learns to map LR images to their corresponding HR counterparts by leveraging GANs architecture and adversarial training.

- **Discriminator**: The discriminator network learns to distinguish between real HR images and fake HR images generated by the generator. It provides feedback to the generator, guiding it to produce more realistic HR images.

## Training

The model is trained using the LR-HR image pairs from the training dataset. During training, the generator and discriminator networks are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator aims to produce realistic HR images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to correctly classify real and fake HR images.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained SR model is evaluated on the validation dataset. Quantitative metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) are computed to assess the quality of the generated HR images compared to ground truth HR images.
